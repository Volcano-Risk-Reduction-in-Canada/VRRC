Parent Repo for Volcanic Risk Reduction in Canada Project's Github Presence

Volcanoes are complex systems with multiple destructive phenomena with hazard footprints from a few to thousands of kilometres. Canada has 28 dormant volcanoes, all in BC and the Yukon. The annual probability of an eruption in Canada is at least 1/200. While eruptions are infrequent, even small events may have devastating impacts: the 1700 CE eruption of Tseax cone in BC caused the deaths of 2000 Nisgaâ€™a people. Five Canadian volcanoes pose High to Very High threats (Figure 1A), based on a semi-quantitative assessment of geology and exposure factors. This high-impact, low-frequency hazard is underrepresented in basic research and risk reduction.

Volcano Risk Reduction in Canada aims to reduce the risk of volcanic eruptions to the Canadian population by quantifying hazard and risk and implementing routine monitoring. Much of the work presented here revolves around satellite based monitoring implementations that are intended to screen for magmatic unrest. 

A note on open science: we strive to implement, where possible, TBS directives on Open Science and Open Government. We plan to implement an 'Open by Default' model as described by the Office of the Chief Science Advisor:
